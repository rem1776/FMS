# FMS Documentation Homepage

This is the documentation homepage for the Flexible Modeling System(FMS), a software environment built for supporting atmospheric, oceanic, and climate system models on high-end computing architectures.

For more general information on FMS, it's uses, scope, and licensing, please see the project's
description page [here](README.md).

For documentation on the FMS codebase, a top level view of all modules by subdirectory can be
found in the 'Modules' section in the sidebar, or linked [**here**](modules.html).

All project code and contributing information can be found at <https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS>

 <OVERVIEW>
   <TT>mpp_mod</TT>, is a set of simple calls to provide a uniform interface
   to different message-passing libraries. It currently can be
   implemented either in the SGI/Cray native SHMEM library or in the MPI
   standard. Other libraries (e.g MPI-2, Co-Array Fortran) can be
   incorporated as the need arises.
 </OVERVIEW>
 <DESCRIPTION>
   The data transfer between a processor and its own memory is based
   on <TT>load</TT> and <TT>store</TT> operations upon
   memory. Shared-memory systems (including distributed shared memory
   systems) have a single address space and any processor can acquire any
   data within the memory by <TT>load</TT> and
   <TT>store</TT>. The situation is different for distributed
   parallel systems. Specialized MPP systems such as the T3E can simulate
   shared-memory by direct data acquisition from remote memory. But if
   the parallel code is distributed across a cluster, or across the Net,
   messages must be sent and received using the protocols for
   long-distance communication, such as TCP/IP. This requires a
   `&lsquo;handshaking&rsquo;' between nodes of the distributed system. One can think
   of the two different methods as involving <TT>put</TT>s or
   <TT>get</TT>s (e.g the SHMEM library), or in the case of
   negotiated communication (e.g MPI), <TT>send</TT>s and
   <TT>recv</TT>s.

   The difference between SHMEM and MPI is that SHMEM uses one-sided
   communication, which can have very low-latency high-bandwidth
   implementations on tightly coupled systems. MPI is a standard
   developed for distributed computing across loosely-coupled systems,
   and therefore incurs a software penalty for negotiating the
   communication. It is however an open industry standard whereas SHMEM
   is a proprietary interface. Besides, the <TT>put</TT>s or
   <TT>get</TT>s on which it is based cannot currently be implemented in
   a cluster environment (there are recent announcements from Compaq that
   occasion hope).

   The message-passing requirements of climate and weather codes can be
   reduced to a fairly simple minimal set, which is easily implemented in
   any message-passing API. <TT>mpp_mod</TT> provides this API.

    Features of <TT>mpp_mod</TT> include:
    <ol>
     <li> Simple, minimal API, with free access to underlying API for </li>
       more complicated stuff.<BR/>
     <li> Design toward typical use in climate/weather CFD codes. </li>
     <li> Performance to be not significantly lower than any native API. </li>
    </ol>

   This module is used to develop higher-level calls for <LINK
   SRC="mpp_domains.html">domain decomposition</LINK> and <LINK
   SRC="mpp_io.html">parallel I/O</LINK>.
 <br/> 
   Parallel computing is initially daunting, but it soon becomes
   second nature, much the way many of us can now write vector code
   without much effort. The key insight required while reading and
   writing parallel code is in arriving at a mental grasp of several
   independent parallel execution streams through the same code (the SPMD
   model). Each variable you examine may have different values for each
   stream, the processor ID being an obvious example. Subroutines and
   function calls are particularly subtle, since it is not always obvious
   from looking at a call what synchronization between execution streams
   it implies. An example of erroneous code would be a global barrier
   call (see <LINK SRC="#mpp_sync">mpp_sync</LINK> below) placed
   within a code block that not all PEs will execute, e.g:

   <PRE>
   if( pe.EQ.0 )call mpp_sync()
   </PRE>

   Here only PE 0 reaches the barrier, where it will wait
   indefinitely. While this is a particularly egregious example to
   illustrate the coding flaw, more subtle versions of the same are
   among the most common errors in parallel code.
  <br/>
   It is therefore important to be conscious of the context of a
   subroutine or function call, and the implied synchronization. There
   are certain calls here (e.g <TT>mpp_declare_pelist, mpp_init,
   mpp_set_stack_size</TT>) which must be called by all
   PEs. There are others which must be called by a subset of PEs (here
   called a <TT>pelist</TT>) which must be called by all the PEs in the
   <TT>pelist</TT> (e.g <TT>mpp_max, mpp_sum, mpp_sync</TT>). Still
   others imply no synchronization at all. I will make every effort to
   highlight the context of each call in the MPP modules, so that the
   implicit synchronization is spelt out.
 <br/>
   For performance it is necessary to keep synchronization as limited
   as the algorithm being implemented will allow. For instance, a single
   message between two PEs should only imply synchronization across the
   PEs in question. A <I>global</I> synchronization (or <I>barrier</I>)
   is likely to be slow, and is best avoided. But codes first
   parallelized on a Cray T3E tend to have many global syncs, as very
   fast barriers were implemented there in hardware.
 <br/>
   Another reason to use pelists is to run a single program in MPMD
   mode, where different PE subsets work on different portions of the
   code. A typical example is to assign an ocean model and atmosphere
   model to different PE subsets, and couple them concurrently instead of
   running them serially. The MPP module provides the notion of a
   <I>current pelist</I>, which is set when a group of PEs branch off
   into a subset. Subsequent calls that omit the <TT>pelist</TT> optional
   argument (seen below in many of the individual calls) assume that the
   implied synchronization is across the current pelist. The calls
   <TT>mpp_root_pe</TT> and <TT>mpp_npes</TT> also return the values
   appropriate to the current pelist. The <TT>mpp_set_current_pelist</TT>
   call is provided to set the current pelist.
 </DESCRIPTION>
 <br/>
 <PUBLIC>
  F90 is a strictly-typed language, and the syntax pass of the
  compiler requires matching of type, kind and rank (TKR). Most calls
  listed here use a generic type, shown here as <TT>MPP_TYPE_</TT>. This
  is resolved in the pre-processor stage to any of a variety of
  types. In general the MPP operations work on 4-byte and 8-byte
  variants of <TT>integer, real, complex, logical</TT> variables, of
  rank 0 to 5, leading to 48 specific module procedures under the same
  generic interface. Any of the variables below shown as
  <TT>MPP_TYPE_</TT> is treated in this way.
